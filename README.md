This is a Card Pack Opening Prototype built using Three.js. The project simulates a visually engaging card pack opening experience, suitable for games or collectible card systems. It demonstrates 3D rendering, animations, and interactivity to enhance user engagement. This was inspired by Pokemon TCG Pocket a bit, as I really liked the pack opening experience there.
